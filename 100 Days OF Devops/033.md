## Instructions for Resolving the Issue

- **SSH Access:**
  - SSH into the storage server using username `max` and password `Max_pass123`.
  - Under `/home/max`, you will find the `story-blog` repository.
  - Try to push the changes to the origin repo and fix any issues.
  - Ensure that `story-index.txt` contains titles for all 4 stories.
  - Correct the typo in "The Lion and the Mooose" line, where "Mooose" should be "Mouse".
